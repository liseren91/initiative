# Initiative

A self-hosted project management platform designed for friend groups, gaming communities, and small teams who want an intuitive way to organize projects, share documents, and track tasks — without the complexity of enterprise tools.

> **Pre-release software** — this project hasn't reached v1.0.0 yet. The API may change between minor releases.

## What is Initiative?

Initiative is project management for people who don't want to think about project management. It's built for groups that need to coordinate work, share information, and stay on the same page — whether you're running a tabletop campaign, organizing a community event, or managing a small team.

- **Guilds** keep each group's data completely separate — run multiple communities from one instance
- **Initiatives** organize related projects and documents so nothing gets lost
- **Drag-and-drop boards** make task tracking visual and immediate
- **Collaborative documents** let your team write and edit together in real time
- **Simple sharing** — control who sees what without needing a degree in access management
- **Self-hosted with Docker** — your data stays on your hardware

## Key Features

### Guilds

Each guild is a completely separate workspace — your D&D group and your work team never see each other's data, even on the same server.

- **True data isolation**: PostgreSQL Row Level Security enforces guild boundaries at the database layer
- **Switch between guilds instantly**: Join multiple guilds and move between them with one click
- **Invite links**: Share links with optional expiry dates and usage limits
- **Controlled creation**: Optionally restrict guild creation for hosted deployments

**Guild settings:**

### Initiatives & Projects

Initiatives group related projects and documents together — think of them as folders for an entire effort (a campaign, an event, a product).

- **Everything in one place**: Bundle projects, documents, and team members under a single initiative
- **Automatic scoping**: Members only see initiatives they belong to
- **Custom project boards**: Drag-and-drop Kanban boards with customizable task statuses
- **Color-coded organization**: Visual distinction with initiative-specific colors

**Initiatives page:**

### Simple Sharing & Permissions

Sharing is straightforward: add people to a guild, add them to an initiative, then choose who can see or edit each project and document. No complicated admin panels required.

- **Initiative roles**: Create roles like "player" or "DM" with different feature access
- **Project & document sharing**: Set owner, write, or read access per user or per role
- **Role-based grants**: Share with an entire role at once instead of adding people one by one

For details on how access control is enforced under the hood, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
